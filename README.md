# KasBaik
This project is our final project for Google Bangkit Academy 2022.

**Android:**
[KasBaik-App](https://github.com/imamfirdaus-if/kasbaik/tree/main/android)

**Cloud:**

**Machine Learning:**

**Backgrounder:**

The rise of illicit lending has pushed those who are in haste to borrow from shark loans or illegal funding, which charge high interest and put them under a lot of emotional pressure. This product come with 0% interest and long tenure that adjusted to their ability, so they can be confident to pay back and ease to use the capital support wisely.
Since awareness of anti-riba is increasing, and more and more people are aware of it, we have to chase the opportunity to provide a shariah-compliant product. On top of that, we believed that with the sharia concept, the system would have more barokah. 

For technology, we use all types of technology needed such as Machine Learning to make credit approval and credit scoring automatically. We will also use cloud computing to create an integrated loan and payment tracking system for each use, so that we can monitor the flow of the funds we disburse.

This product is a platform that aims to form finance within the scope of the community/micro business. This financial assistance is in the form of cyclical productive capital with installment payments based on the ability of the borrower and without usury.
This product will help people who need loans but are worried about the majority of the existing lending system, such as high interest rates, etc. This product is also a solution for people who want to give charity to help people who need a loan but are not sure where to place their donations because they are still worried about the element of usury in it.



## Thank You :)
